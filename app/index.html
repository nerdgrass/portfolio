              <span>Hi! I’m Alex. I’m a designer and a developer</span>, focused on making meaningful experiences for users on the web. You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/nerdgrass">GitHub</a>, pixels on <a href="http://dribbble.com/nerdgrass">Dribbble</a>, and finished work below.
            </p>
            <p>
              I live and work somewhere between artist and engineer. I strive to find the beauty in efficient design, whether that design is ink on paper or code executed on a server. I primarily work with Ruby on Rails and Node.js, though I’ve dabbled with other frameworks and languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently a proud student of the <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/">Startup Institute</a>, furthering my knowledge of web development and attending entirely too many networking events.

                      If there’s one word that could define Abine’s culture, its speed. Within a week of me starting, my first code was live to millions of users. Every ounce of the startup’s workflow was devoted to developing and iterating as fast as possible. As with many design projects, an enforced constraint can bring up new answers to old questions, and moving so swiftly on a regular basis ensures work at Abine is always iterative and never wasteful.

                      The downside to ‘failing faster’ is that there can be a plethora of orphaned features, products, and pages. When you change rapidly for a long enough time, consistency becomes a major issue. Part of my work at Abine has been taking responsibility for building a cohesive brand around their three products: MaskMe, DeleteMe, and DoNotTrackMe. This culminated in a brand-wide refresh of design applied to Abine and all their products, creating a unified and extensible design that was clean, friendly, and focused.

                    <p>
                      But branding doesn’t end with a stylesheet; I wanted to help Abine build a cohesive user experience around consumer privacy, and that meant digging into the UI. Built with Backbone and Marionette.js, I help optimize DoNotTrackMe’s experience to match the brand’s expectations of fast, focused, and friendly privacy for everyday consumers. This ranges from cleaning up the UI, refactoring legacy code, and helping design new features.
