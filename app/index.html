              Howdy! I’m Alex. I’m a designer and a developer, focused on making meaningful experiences for users on the web or mobile devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I live and work somewhere between artist and engineer. While I went to school for illustration in such mediums as gouache and charcoal, I found that traditional media wasn’t as powerful or flexible for the art I wanted to make. Digital artwork was a step in the right direction, but I wasn’t satisfied. Teaching myself web design, I saw that programming enabled me to work upon an infinite canvas of infinite possibilities. From then on, I was hooked and I’ve been trying to weave programming and art together ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              My primary tools these days are Javascript, Ruby, Sass, Sketch, and Creative Suite. I work with Backbone and Angular.js to create dynamic and flexible user interfaces, Node.js and Ruby on Rails when I need a backend for an application, and Foundation and Bootstrap when I need to make a polished UI fast. I automate my workflow with Yeoman, edit my code with Sublime Text, and version control ALL the things with Git.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m a proud alumni of Startup Institute: Boston’s web developer track. I currently teach front-end development and javascript on a volunteer basis for both product and dev tracks as well as co-organize the SIB TechShare meet up.

                      If there’s one word that could define Abine’s culture, its speed. Within a week of me starting, my first code was live to millions of users. Every ounce of the startup’s workflow was devoted to developing and iterating as fast as possible. As with many design projects, an enforced constraint can bring up new answers to old questions, and moving so swiftly on a regular basis ensures work at Abine is always iterative and never wasteful.

                      The downside to ‘failing faster’ is that there can be a plethora of orphaned features, products, and pages. When you change rapidly for a long enough time, consistency becomes a major issue. Part of my work at Abine has been taking responsibility for building a cohesive brand around their three products: MaskMe, DeleteMe, and DoNotTrackMe. This culminated in a brand-wide refresh of design applied to Abine and all their products, creating a unified and extensible design that was clean, friendly, and focused.

                      But branding doesn’t end with a stylesheet; I wanted to help Abine build a cohesive user experience around consumer privacy, and that meant digging into the UI. Built with Backbone and Marionette.js, I help optimize DoNotTrackMe’s experience to match the brand’s expectations of fast, focused, and friendly privacy for everyday consumers. This ranges from cleaning up the UI, refactoring legacy code, and helping design new features.

                      I applied to Startup Institute to reintroduce me to the Boston tech scene and help me transition into a role as a front-end developer. While living in the Boston area for over a year prior to SIB, I had a limited network and was stuck with a chicken-and-egg scenario of trying to find front-end dev jobs with little experience working as a developer. I needed  something to help propel me to where I wanted to be, and SIB was that push.

                      One of the key differences between Startup Institute and comparable programs is the focus on culture and self-reliance. As a self-taught designer and developer, this philosophy appealed to me over stricter programs. Devoting time exclusively to learning after so many years of doing it exclusively on my off time was incredible; time to create, direction, and a thriving community proved to be the cornerstones of my experience.

                      The lasting part of Startup Institute won’t be the code. It’ll be the incredible community that I now am immersed in. While working with partner companies such as One Mighty Roar and Ovuline, I spent my days meeting with as many developers as I could, hearing firsthand stories of success, failure, creation, and how to survive as a developer.

                        The final branding ended up focusing on what S4 does: bold and tasteful use of light and color. Using a diverse palette with a minimal user interface lends itself to focus on the color and typography of any given display, resulting in a playful, but professional presence to whatever media S4 appears on.

                      Adapting the album cover for the eponymous first album of Dead Pop Stars Society for the web was a small, but incredibly fun project. Choosing to let the gorgeous album art speak for itself, I chose to focus my efforts on animating the album’s landing page to create a more immersive feeling for a page with little actual content.

                      Before OPM.gov, I was not particularly fluent in Javascript. Due to the constraints of this gigantic project (200+ pages of content for the about section), using many of my staple frameworks and libraries was out of the question. I was immersed in vanilla JS, expanding my understanding of jQuery and javascript to well-beyond what it had been previously. This was when I first experienced the magical feeling of breathing life into a design for the first time when code executes successfully.

                        The other wonderful part about working on OPM.gov was the fact that our team of around 20+ developers was entirely remote. I had never worked a full-time, long-term remote job before, and while I was wary at first I ended up loving it. Being able to code on my own schedule amidst a team, with the flexibility to go anywhere and still be able to work was incredibly liberating.
